## To-do list and roadmap
Just something to help me organise what I next need to do.

1. Automatic rank changes based on age (kits -> apprentices, apprentices -> warriors, warriors -> elders, deputy -> leader)
2. Every moon, an Elder has a chance to die from old age
3. Mentors & apprentices
4. When the player clicks on a member's name, a popup will display their information
5. This popup will also allow player to change information (e.g. rank, name, patrol, mentor)
6. Pair up cats into mates
7. Mates have a flat chance to become pregnant
8. Pregnancy mechanic (+ litter generated)
9. Once a queen has been pregnant for THREE moons, she will give birth to kits
10. Family relationship flags
11. Once a queen's kits are weaned/become apprentices, she becomes a queen again
12. Sprite design for every rank
- kits
- apprentices
- warriors
- pregnant queens
- nursing queens
- medicine cats
- leaders

8. Seasons
9. Medicine cats & herbs
10. Less herbs -> worse health, birth complications (kits can be born stillborn, born sickly, mother can die/be sickly, etc.)
11. No medicine cat -> worse health (these two effects will stack)
12. Logo design
13. UI design
14. Family trees (recognise and display familial relationships)
15. Key art
16. Sexual-orientation (+changing)
17. Pronouns (+changing)
18. Personalities, Happiness, & autonomous Relationships
19. + UI change for breeding (cats must be compatible)
20. Spontaneous relationship changes
21. Stats & proficiency
22. Bonus UI designs
23. Changing clan's biome
