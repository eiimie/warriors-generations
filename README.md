# Warriors Generations

Please note: This is a non-profit fangame based on the Warriors series by Erin Hunter made out of a passion for the books. Copyright belongs to its rightful owners.

<b>Warriors: Generations</b> is a simulation game based on the <i>Warriors book series</i> by Erin Hunter, having taken inspiration from games such as <i>Lioden</i>, <i>Niche: A Genetics Survival Game</i>, <i>Flight Rising</i>, and even <i>Rimworld</i> a teeny bit. The goal is to play as the leader of a clan and ensure its survival while carefully managing it over many generations. 

I've had the idea for this project for years - since I first got into the book series in my mid teens. As someone who's always been a fan of genetics breeding games, I loved the idea of controlling my own multi-generational clan and seeing it grow from humble beginnings. I played the Sims 3 Warriors Challenge a lot but it never really scratched the itch. I first committed to this game in 2022 when I was in sixth form, intending to build it in Python, but it was only when I started university that I became truly serious about seeing my idea come to fruition. 

## So, what's it about? 

The player is put into the position of a clan's Leader and has the responsibility to manage the clan. The game is turn-based; every moon (month) characters will age up, expecting mothers can give birth, characters can die, and special events can happen. The gameplay is centred around the resource and social management of a group of characters. Watch out for leafbare (winter) or you might find your entire clan wiped out within a few months. Selectively breed for the genetics you want, but be careful about how you do it - because the way you breed your clan can have some <i>disastrous</i> effects in the long-term...
